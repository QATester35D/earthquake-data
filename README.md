# earthquake-data
This repo uses the USGS earthquake API data from around the world for a specified timeframe.

Using the API from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/ to get earthquake data that is recorded and reported from around the world for specified timeframes (start date and end date) in the data request. The sites used for the data interpretations comes from:
- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson_detail.php
- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/index.php#tsunami

I then process through the data to create new data points.
